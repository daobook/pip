"The :ref:`wheel cache <Wheel cache>` is disabled in hash-checking mode to"

"complication is that locally built wheels are nondeterministic: "
"contemporary modification times make their way into the archive, making "
"hashes unpredictable across machines and cache flushes. Compilation of C "
"code adds further nondeterminism, as many compilers include random-seeded"
" values in their output. However, wheels fetched from index servers are "
"the same every time. They land in pip's HTTP cache, not its wheel cache, "

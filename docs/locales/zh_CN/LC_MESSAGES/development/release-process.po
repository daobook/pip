"The pip project has a release cadence of releasing whatever is on "
"``main`` every 3 months. This gives users a predictable pattern for when "
"releases are going to happen and prevents locking up improvements for "
"fixes for long periods of time, while still preventing massively "
"fracturing the user base with version numbers."

msgid ""
"Our release months are January, April, July, October. The release date "
"within that month will be up to the release manager for that release. If "
"there are no changes, then that release month is skipped and the next "
"release will be 3 months later."

"The release manager may, at their discretion, choose whether or not there"
" will be a pre-release period for a release, and if there is may extend "
"that period into the next month if needed."

"Because releases are made direct from the ``main`` branch, it is "
"essential that ``main`` is always in a releasable state. It is acceptable"
" to merge PRs that partially implement a new feature, but only if the "
"partially implemented version is usable in that state (for example, with "
"reduced functionality or disabled by default). In the case where a merged"
" PR is found to need extra work before being released, the release "
"manager always has the option to back out the partial change prior to a "
"release. The PR can then be reworked and resubmitted for the next "
"release."

"Any change to pip that removes or significantly alters user-visible "

"Certain changes may be fast tracked and have a deprecation period of 3 "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Deprecation will take the form of a warning being issued by pip when the "
"feature is used. Longer deprecation periods, or deprecation warnings for "
"behavior changes that would not normally be covered by this policy, are "
"also possible depending on circumstances, but this is at the discretion "
"of the pip maintainers."

"Note that the documentation is the sole reference for what counts as "
"agreed behavior. If something isn't explicitly mentioned in the "
"documentation, it can be changed without warning, or any deprecation "
"period, in a pip release. However, we are aware that the documentation "
"isn't always complete - PRs that document existing behavior with the "
"intention of covering that behavior with the above deprecation process "
"are always acceptable, and will be considered on their merits."
